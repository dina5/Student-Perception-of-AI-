# Student-Perception-of-AI-
This is a personal research project that looks at the relationship between AI and students in an educational context, with a particular emphasis on HCI principles in educational AI systems. The study delved into students' knowledge levels and attitudes toward AI, demonstrating that my interest in technology extended beyond my academic major. The findings of this project shed light on the evolving role of AI in education and its impact on various disciplines. While this analysis remains a work in progress, it has already unveiled a range of insights. Notably, the majority of students demonstrated AI knowledge ratings falling within the 4 to 8 range, with the internet emerging as their primary source of AI-related information. When it came to attitudes toward AI, students predominantly fell into one of two categories: those with optimistic perspectives, believing AI can solve problems and boost the economy, and those with more pessimistic views, concerned that AI might reduce human opportunities, including job prospects. Interestingly, higher AI knowledge ratings tended to correlate with more optimistic opinions. Furthermore, a significant portion of students expressed curiosity about AI, indicating a growing interest in the field. Students also foresaw medicine as the domain most impacted by AI, with art expected to experience the least influence. Notably, AI knowledge ratings were found to be correlated with utility grading. The survey had a strong representation of female third-year students in the fields of statistics and economic forecasting, while male students in the survey had notably lower exam pass rates. Lastly, there was a weak correlation between AI knowledge ratings and GPA. These findings offer valuable insights into students' perceptions of AI and its implications for various domains.
